# Health Equity Tracker - Production
This repository contains the production deployment configuration and resources for the [Health Equity Tracker](https://healthequitytracker.org/) project. It serves as an extension of the main [Health Equity Tracker development repository](https://github.com/SatcherInstitute/health-equity-tracker).

## Purpose
This repository manages production-specific configurations, deployment workflows, and resources required for the live Health Equity Tracker application. By separating production concerns from the main development repository, we can maintain a cleaner workflow and more secure production environment.
